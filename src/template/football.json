          "text": "<i>by Alessandro Barilaro and Jonathan Pertile</i><br><br>Football is a game replete with money. Sponsorship, Television deals, merchandising; the copious amount of currency fills world football; and it's all circulated in a market where players are constantly moving. In order for a player to move, one club must bid a certain amount of money; the player's parent club must accept, and the deal then moves onward. All of this is compounded under what's called the Transfer Market; a market where players are constantly moving from one club to another. <br>With more and more money injected into the game at any one point; players continue to cost more and more. Here, we delve into just how much money permeates the game of football via the five most expensive transfers of all time.&nbsp;<br><br>As respected author of 9 books on Liverpool Football Club,&nbsp;and founder of Transfer Price Index (a website that specialises in analysing the transfer market) Paul Tomkins states; while these represent the most significant outlays of money ever spent on a player; they're not the&nbsp;<em>best</em> deals ever done. In fact, often the&nbsp;<em>best</em> deals involved these players; such as how Tomkins says; <b>\"Manchester United\u2019s purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo has to go down as the best bit of business. He cost a reasonable fee for his age [\u00a312 million pounds], but eventually he repaid that with title-winning performances and then left for Madrid for a world-record fee [\u00a380 million pounds].\"</b> The trend is something that all these deals share; as Paul states; <b>\"</b><span><b>I think these are the ideal transfers: buy low, get exceptional performances for a number of years and sell incredibly high.\"</b></span><br><span><br>He also demonstrates just how colossal the amount of money in football really is; saying <b>\"</b></span><b>UK retail inflation (the average cost of a product as covered by the Retail Price Index) hasn\u2019t even doubled since 1992; whereas the average price of a transfer is currently 13 times what it was 24 years ago, and that\u2019s before taking this past summer into account [When Paul Pogba moved for&nbsp;</b><span><b>\u00a389 million]</b></span><b>. In the past two or three years we\u2019re talking about the average price of a PL footballer doubling.\"</b><br><br>But see for yourself; here are the five most expensive transfers in world football; to show just how much money pervades the world of football.&nbsp;"
