      "question": "Why aren't my Google Drive or DropBox Zoomify images working?",
      "answer": "<p>Unfortunately, Google has <a href='http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2015/08/deprecating-web-hosting-support-in.html'>deprecated web hosting in Google Drive</a>, which means that Zoomify images hosted on Google Drive. will no longer display. Dropbox has similary <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/help/16'>discontinued rendering content in public folders</a>, so this method will cause problems for many users as well.</p> <p>We find that many people aren't familiar with web image hosting, so we've written up instructions for two solutions so far: hosting on <a href='https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/AWS_Hosting/AWS_Hosting.md'>Amazon Web Services</a>, and on <a href='https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/GITHUB_HOSTING/GITHUB_HOSTING.md'>Github</a>.</p>"

Its value should be a number from 0 to one less than the total number of slides in the storymap.</p> <p><strong>For example:</strong> <code>http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storymapjs/latest/embed/?url=//media.knightlab.com/StoryMapJS/demo/sochi.json&start_at_slide=5</code></p><p>This should load <q>Sochi 2014 Olympic Torch Relay Highlights: Slide 5.</q></p>"

If the server supports multiple subdomains, enter them as a single string in the Subdomain field (e.g. subdomains 'a', 'b', and 'c' should be entered as 'abc')."

      "question": "How can I adjust the zoom?",
      "answer": "<p>To keep it simple for most users, we've made some assumptions in the authoring tool which may not universally apply. For example, the first screen is always an <code>overview</code> slide. Also, the zoom is affected by the overall size of the map and the relationship between the current and previous points on the map.</p> <p>It's possible to download the configuration (a JSON file) that the authoring tool makes and edit the JSON yourself. You could then change the first slide to not be an <code>overview</code> and manually set a starting lat/lon/zoom.</p> <p>Be aware that switching back and forth between editing within and outside the authoring tool can get messy, so we suggest using our <a href='https://storymap.knightlab.com/advanced/'>advanced</a> method to have maximum control over the zoom feature and more.</p>"
